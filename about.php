                Seasonation is a community-driven Minecraft civilization experiment.
                <br><br>
                We organize events, or "seasons" where players must cooperate together and organize as nations
                that will compete against each other
                <br>
                in a hand-crafted map on our private minecraft server, for a duration of two weeks.
                <br><br>
                Players have limited lives and those who are eliminated
                must wait for the next event to start participating again.
                <br><br>
                In Seasonation, there are no laws but those decided by the players themselves and nations are free to declare war on each other as they please.
                <br><br>
                The next event is scheduled for June 20th 2023. On that date, sign-up will be closed for this season
