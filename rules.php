                    <ul>
                        <li>You are not allowed to join a <b>civilization</b> with the intent to grief or sabotage that <b>civilization</b> in any way.
                        This can include: stealing, leaking information, murdering members, destroying civilization property to cause harm, or any other relevant reason.
                        Breaking this rule can lead to disqualification. Disqualification is an instant ban until the next season.</li><br>
                        <li>Although there are very few rules regarding PvP, the server's main focus is a <b>civilization experiment</b>. Joining the server for the sole purpose of
                        farming players for XP and being a nuisance is prohibited. Breaking this rule repeatedly can lead to the player getting sent to the <b>Warden Pit</b>.</li><br>
                        <li>Intentionally causing server lag is prohibited and will get you <b>banned from the event</b>. An example of this is entity cramming from mob grinders.</li><br>
                        <li>Use your common sense! If you think something is against the rules or goes against the spirit of the event, don't be afraid to ask in the discord server.</li><br>
                    </ul>
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Hacking / Exploiting</b>
                    <br><br>
                    If you are caught:
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Using client modification to gain an unfair advantage over other players (ESP, X-Ray, Killaura, Autoclicker, Flying, Speedhack, etc)</li>
                        <li>Exploiting the plugins in the game (Gaining an extra life, bypassing enchant restrictions, etc)</li>
                        <li>Using ingame glitches (Duplication, etc)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <b>You will receive a permanent ban from the event, any future events and the communications server. You will receive no warning, do not attempt to test the staff.</b>
