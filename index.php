                    <b>June 20th to July 4th</b>
                    <br><br><br>
                    <b>What is this experiment?</b>
                    <br>
                    On June 20th 2023, 100+ players will be placed randomly onto a hand-crafted frozen island with harsh conditions, 
                    sparse resources and secret locations where players must choose their actions wisely in order to survive. 
                    The goal of the experiment? To observe how factions and civilizations naturally emerge in this <b>lawless and brutal environment</b> over the course of two weeks. 
                    Players are not held to any strict rules, except those written in the Rules Section</a>. 
                    Players will be free to form nations and civilizations and survive together, or explore the world alone.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Death</b>
                    <br>
                    Players will only have 3 lives. When their lives run out, they will be eliminated until next season. 
                    If you happen to lose your last life due to a glitch or cheater, then video evidence is required for you to be eligible for a restore. 
                    Death due to internet connection issues are not restorable.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Enchantments</b>
                    <br>
                    We are limiting the use of a number of enchantments this season. This shouldn't affect players too much as the plugin will automatically
                    downgrade the limited enchantments to the allowed level or stop you from enchanting an item with a disabled enchantment.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Other dimensions</b>
                    <br>
                    Access to the Nether and The End will be disabled. However, there will be secret locations players can discover which contain items from those dimensions.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Factions</b>
                    <br>
                    Players are free to create their own factions as they please, or play alone. There will be a plugin to allow the creation of factions in-game, and players may post
                    links to their faction discord on the official Seasonation's discord, in the channel provided for this purpose.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>How to join the event</b>
                    <br>
                    Players must join the official discord, linked at the top of the page or in the Contact section. 
                    A Google form will be posted in our discord where players must enter their discord and minecraft username before the start date.
                    You must own a legitimate copy of Minecraft to participate.
                    The form will be available until the season starts. Applications will not be considered after the start date.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Daily schedule</b>
                    <br>
                    The server will be open every day for the duration of the event, between <b>3pm - 8pm UTC</b> during weekdays and <b>1pm - 9pm UTC</b> during weekends.
                    This is to prevent players taking advantage of timezones and sleep hours to gain an unfair advantage over other players.
